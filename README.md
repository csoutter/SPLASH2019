Nicholas Day and I are creating two different projects for high school students to use and practice the fundamentals of web development.

Cassidy is creating the customizable magic 8 ball, while Nick is creating a bouncing ball. Both will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript as a way to make these mini sites more interactive and fun!
